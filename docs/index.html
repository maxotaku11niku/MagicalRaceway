					<h1>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h1>
					<h2>This game is not finished yet!</h2>
					<p>Therefore, not all the content is in the game. Please do give feedback on these development versions.</p>
				</div>
				<p><span class="bold">Magical Raceway</span> is a simple racing game that I developed solo. Inspired by classic arcade games, I hope it will be at least fun enough for short sessions. Unlike most racing games, though, it's about magical girls flying very quickly, though I don't think this is a revolutionary change since putting cute girls into stuff that didn't have them in the first place is <span class="italic">so</span> overdone. Like games such as <span class="italic">OutRun</span>, you race against the clock, so don't crash into anything!.</p>
				<p>This game is available for Windows, Linux and Android. When this game is further into its development I will put it on more conventional platforms rather than hosting releases on GitHub, which means something like itch.io (not Steam: this game is too simple to justify being on Steam in my opinion) or Google Play.</p>

				<h1>What's in it?</h1>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="../assets/v0_5st1.png" class="previewImage"/>
							<h2>Game Content</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Five stages of racing against the clock, trying not to crash into other magical girls or stuff off the road!</li>
								<li>Scoring system based on how quickly you complete the track, and also how risky you play.</li>
								<li>Highscores are saved for later (but only locally, unfortunately). See if you can beat my scores!</li>
								<li>No need for anything overcomplicated: it's short and simple, and doesn't demand you come back every day for some silly rewards. Contains <span class="bold">absolutely no</span> microtransactions nor adverts to distract you and drain your wallet.</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<table>

						<td>
							<img src="../assets/v0_5st3.png" class="previewImage"/>
							<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Pixellated graphics by yours truly meant to evoke the 16-bit era, with a pseudo-3D look that is meant to be consistent with what would have been possible with 1990s-era home systems. It's pretty cartoony, as well.</li>
								<li>Set in a magical world, but clearly one in which technology (magitek) has advanced beyond even our world's level. <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic">Sufficiently Analysed Magic</a> is in effect. This is my justification for the first stage looking like typical modern suburbia, among other things.</li>
								<li>95% genuine emulated Yamaha YM2608 FM soundchip sound. It's still chiptune, you know. All songs by yours truly.</li>
							</ul>

				<h1>Current plans</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Do three more tracks, each harder and longer than the last. Medium difficulty will be somewhat challenging, Hard difficulty will be very hard, and Insane difficulty will challenge even me!</li>
						<li>Make the crashing behaviour much more interesting than 'oh you hit an obstacle, your speed will now instantly be reduced to zero'.</li>
						<li>Add some more magical girls and a lot more animations so it looks better, of course.</li>
						<li>Messages from Tachya??? (the player character)</li>
