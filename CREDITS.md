Programming, Art, Music, Design:

- Maxim Hoxha

Software used:

- [Unity](https://unity.com/) (game engine)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (short programming tasks)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (programming)
- [Frhed](http://frhed.sourceforge.net/en/) \[FreeHexEditor\] (binary data manipulation)
- [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/index.html) (art/graphics)
- [MilkyTracker](https://milkytracker.org/) (sound effects)
- [BambooTracker](https://github.com/BambooTracker/BambooTracker) (music; a Yamaha YM2608 tracker and thus can emulate this sound chip. The source code was modified to allow files to be played by the game; the source code is available from the repository linked)
- [Pro Music Driver](http://www5.airnet.ne.jp/kajapon/tool.html) (M. Kajihara/KAJA) (where the beat samples ultimately come from)
- YMFM OPNA emulator (non-standard OPNA emulation core, from the source code to PMDWin, available from [this Japanese-language site](http://c60.la.coocan.jp/index.html). Go to the link that has 'Download Page' and scroll to 'PMDWin 再現性・音質優先版のソース'. Please do make me aware of the actual site YMFM itself is hosted, however C60 did modify the version I used to emulate OPNA.)
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) (virtual machine for testing)

Special Thanks (contributors/supporters):

- Sam (first playtester, pointed out dumb game design in v0.2)
- rerrahkr & the other contributors to BambooTracker (thanks for ensuring my music files stay nice and small)
- Aaron Giles (developer of the YMFM OPNA emulator. Thanks for giving me a way to keep my game CC-BY-NC)
- C60 (thanks for providing the source code to PMDWin, which has the source code to ymfm)
