# Magical Raceway

**Retro arcade racing game with magical girls**

## The game

**Magical Raceway** is a simple racing game that I developed solo. Inspired by classic arcade games, I hope it will be at least fun enough for short sessions. Unlike most racing games, though, it's about magical girls flying very quickly, though I don't think this is a revolutionary change since putting cute girls into stuff that didn't have them in the first place is *so* overdone. Like games such as *OutRun*, you race against the clock, so don't crash into anything!. The game is still under development so please do report any bugs and make some suggestions!

This game is available for Windows, Linux and Android. When this game is further into its development I will put it on more conventional platforms rather than hosting releases on GitHub, which means something like itch.io (not Steam: this game is too simple to justify being on Steam in my opinion) or Google Play.

## This repository

This is the source code and assets to Magical Raceway. Although this game is a Godot project, all that is contained here would be enough to reconstruct the game in pretty much any environment, if you have enough time, that is. You can open an issue if you have a bug to report or something to request, and I will respond.

Code from [Bamboo Tracker](https://github.com/BambooTracker/BambooTracker) used for Yamaha YM2608 (PC-9801-86) emulation and .btm file playback. See [BambooTrackerPlayer](https://github.com/maxotaku11niku/BambooTrackerPlayer) for more details. If you clone this repository remember to put the release files from there into `Godot/bin/`.
