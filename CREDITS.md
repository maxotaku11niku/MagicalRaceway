Programming, Art, Music, Design:

- Maxim Hoxha

Software used (since the Godot port started):

- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (game engine)
- [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) (text file writing)
- [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) (executable compression)
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (art/graphics)
- [BambooTracker](https://github.com/BambooTracker/BambooTracker) (music; a Yamaha YM2608 tracker and thus can emulate this sound chip. The source code was modified to allow files to be played by the game; the source code is available from the repository linked)
- [Pro Music Driver](http://www5.airnet.ne.jp/kajapon/tool.html) (M. Kajihara/KAJA) (where the beat samples ultimately come from)

Special Thanks (contributors/supporters):

- Sam (first playtester, pointed out dumb game design in v0.2, when Unity was still being used)
- rerrahkr & the other contributors to BambooTracker (thanks for ensuring my music files stay nice and small)
